This header is a test tool. This header provides the following facilities.

ASSERT is an variadic macro that prints an error message to stderr and
increments the value of global variable status if the first argument is
false. The error message contains the filename and the line number of the
failed macro invocation followed by the failed expression, followed by the
names and values of the arguments of ASSERT starting from the second
argument.

status is a global variable that captures the number of times ASSERT failed.
status can reach the max value of 64.

PRINT is a variadic macro that prints the name and value of its arguments
starting from the second.

This header is supposed to be copied to your project and included in a test
program.

#include "test.h"
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    ASSERT(x == y, x, y);
    return status;
}
Running this program produces
t.cpp:5: assertion `x == y' failed x = `1', y = `2'

To invoke ASSERT from multiple threads status can be made an atomic int in
the working copy of test.h.
